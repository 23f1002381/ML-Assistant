
You are a senior Machine Learning Engineer and Full-Stack Developer.

I have nothing created yet.
I want to build a complete project from scratch:

🎯 Project Title:

Smart Business Card Intelligence System (OCR + ML + Excel Export)

This must go from:

Basic working version
→ ML-enhanced version
→ Clean professional UI
→ Deployment-ready system

Do NOT overcomplicate.
No GPU.
No transformers.
No cloud APIs.
Must run locally on Python 3.10.

🔵 PHASE 1 — BASIC WORKING SYSTEM

Build a clean, minimal working system:

Requirements:

Accept image upload (single or multiple up to 20)

Use EasyOCR for text extraction

Use regex + heuristics for entity extraction

Extract:

Name

Company

Designation

Phone

Email

Website

Address

Convert structured output into Excel (.xlsx)

Provide simple Streamlit UI

Folder Structure:
business-card-ml/

├── requirements.txt

├── src/
│   ├── image_processor.py
│   ├── ocr_engine.py
│   ├── entity_baseline.py
│   ├── excel_exporter.py
│   └── utils.py
│
├── uploads/
└── output/


Code must:

Use modular structure

Include docstrings

Include type hints

Include error handling

Use config variables (no hardcoding)

Make sure Phase 1 works fully before moving to Phase 2.

🟣 PHASE 2 — REAL ML TRAINING

Now convert this into a real ML project.

Add:

src/
    dataset_builder.py
    train_ner.py
    evaluate.py
    entity_trained.py

data/
    raw_cards/
    annotations.json
    train.spacy
    dev.spacy

models/
    trained_model/

reports/
    metrics.json
    comparison.json

Requirements:
dataset_builder.py

Run OCR on images

Allow manual annotation of entities

Convert to spaCy format

Split 80/20

Save train.spacy & dev.spacy

train_ner.py

Create blank spaCy English model

Add NER pipeline

Add labels dynamically

Use minibatching

Use dropout

Log loss per epoch

Save model

evaluate.py

Load trained model

Evaluate on dev set

Compute:

Precision

Recall

F1

Per-entity metrics

Save results in reports/metrics.json

entity_trained.py

Load trained model

Replace baseline extractor

Return confidence scores

🔵 PHASE 3 — MODEL COMPARISON

Add comparison:

Model	Precision	Recall	F1
Baseline	X	X	X
Trained	X	X	X

Save in:

reports/comparison.json

🟢 PHASE 4 — PROFESSIONAL UI

Upgrade UI to look clean and modern.

Requirements:

Drag & drop upload

Support up to 20 images

Model selection dropdown (Baseline / Trained)

Display confidence scores

Editable extracted fields

Export to Excel

Show evaluation metrics

Mobile friendly layout

Loading animation

Keep it simple but professional.

🟡 PHASE 5 — DEPLOYMENT READY

Prepare for deployment:

Add requirements.txt

Add .env support

Add logging system

Add README.md

Ensure app runs with:

streamlit run app.py


Make it compatible with:

Local deployment

Streamlit Cloud

Render (optional)

🧠 ENGINEERING RULES

Modular code

Clean architecture

No hardcoded paths

Type hints everywhere

Docstrings everywhere

Proper logging

No placeholder code

No pseudo code

Provide full working implementation

🎓 FINAL RESULT SHOULD ALLOW ME TO SAY:

“This project implements a domain-specific NER model trained on custom-labeled business card data and demonstrates measurable performance improvement over rule-based baseline extraction.”

Start from Phase 1 only.

Do not jump ahead.

Build step-by-step.

🚀 Why This Prompt Works

It:

Controls scope

Forces phased development

Prevents chaos

Anchors AI behavior

Produces deployable architecture

Keeps ML strong

Keeps UI clean

Avoids overengineering
